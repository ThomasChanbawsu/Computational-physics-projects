This is a list of computational projects I have done during my computational physics module course in UoM


## Second Project: Forced Oscillations

Numerical integration method is a convenient approach for physicists to predict the dynamics of a system if the underlying physics is too complicated. One example of this is a double pendulum.
In this project, the numerical integration approach was studied and applied to a simple oscillation system of a pendulum under different conditions such as damping and forced oscillation by an external force F(t). The following four integration method were used and compared in terms of their accuracy:
1. Euler
2. Improved Euler
3. Verlet
4. Euler-Cromer
Bonuses include looking into the case where the pendulum is oscillated by a sinusoidal wave function and resonance under different damping conditions.
